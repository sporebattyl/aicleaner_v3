[👍/👎]\" feedback (target >95% positive)\n- **Performance Baselines**: AI processing latency benchmarks across different models, memory usage during AI operations (<100MB per concurrent request), cost per successful response tracking, provider failover time (<5 seconds), testing AI performance on low-power hardware (Raspberry Pi compatibility)\n- **Benchmarking Strategy**: Continuous AI performance monitoring with automated regression detection, cost trend analysis with budget alerting, response quality tracking with A/B testing between models, automated performance alerts for AI service degradation\n\n### 5.

Documentation Strategy (User & Developer)\n- **End-User Documentation**: AI provider setup guide with step-by-step configuration instructions and screenshots, AI model selection recommendations based on use cases, cost management and budgeting guidance, troubleshooting guide for common AI issues, visual AI processing workflow using Mermaid.js diagrams, \"What AI Models Are Available?\" comparison guide\n- **Developer Documentation**: AI provider architecture documentation with system design diagrams, API documentation for AI interfaces and extension points, AI performance optimization guidelines, model integration examples and templates, architectural decision records for AI design choices\n- **HA Compliance Documentation**: Home Assistant AI integration requirements checklist, HA addon AI usage guidelines, HA supervisor AI service integration documentation, AI-specific compliance verification procedures, AI service certification submission guidelines\n- **Operational Documentation**: AI provider monitoring and alerting setup procedures, AI cost management and budgeting runbooks, AI performance troubleshooting guides, AI service incident response procedures, AI provider relationship management documentation\n\n## Integration with TDD/AAA Pattern\nAll AI provider components must follow Test-Driven Development with explicit Arrange-Act-Assert structure. Each AI operation should have corresponding tests that validate behavior without incurring API costs through comprehensive mocking. AI response quality should be validated through automated testing frameworks.\n\n## MCP Server Integration Requirements\n- **GitHub MCP**: Version control for AI provider configurations and AI performance tracking with automated testing on AI code changes\n- **WebFetch MCP**: Continuously monitor AI provider API documentation and research latest AI model capabilities and pricing\n- **zen MCP**: Collaborate on complex AI architecture decisions and model selection strategies, arbitrate disagreements in AI implementation approach\n- **Task MCP**: Orchestrate AI testing workflows and performance monitoring automation\n\n## Home Assistant Compliance\nFull compliance with HA addon AI service integration requirements, HA supervisor API usage for secure credential management, and HA security guidelines for external service integration.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n- **Required Tools**: openai, google-generativeai, anthropic, aiohttp, asyncio, redis (for caching), prometheus (for metrics)\n- **AI Providers**: Support for OpenAI GPT models, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, with extensible architecture for additional providers\n- **Performance Requirements**: <2s response time, >99.9% availability, <$0.01 per query cost target\n- **Resource Management**: Intelligent quota management, cost tracking, automatic scaling",

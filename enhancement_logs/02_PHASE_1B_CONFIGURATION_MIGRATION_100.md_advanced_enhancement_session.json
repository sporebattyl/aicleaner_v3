User-Facing Error Reporting Strategy\n- **Error Classification**: Configuration migration failures (legacy format incompatibility, corrupted configuration files, missing required fields), version compatibility errors (unsupported HA version, addon version conflicts), data corruption detection (invalid YAML syntax, truncated files), backup restoration issues (backup file not found, backup corruption, insufficient permissions)\n- **Progressive Error Disclosure**: Simple \"Configuration migration failed - please check settings\" for end users, detailed version compatibility information with specific HA version requirements for troubleshooting, full technical error logs with stack traces and file paths for developers and advanced users\n- **Recovery Guidance**: Step-by-step rollback instructions to restore previous configuration with direct links to specific troubleshooting documentation sections, manual migration procedures with clear validation steps, automated recovery options through backup restoration, \"Copy Error Details\" button for easy support communication\n- **Error Prevention**: Pre-migration validation checks for file integrity and format compatibility, compatibility testing against current HA version, backup verification before migration starts, confirmation dialogs for potentially destructive migration operations\n\n### 2. Structured Logging Strategy\n- **Log Levels**: DEBUG (migration step-by-step details, file parsing progress, validation checks), INFO (migration start/completion, backup creation, version detection), WARN (deprecated configuration options, potential compatibility issues, non-critical migration warnings), ERROR (migration failures, validation errors, backup failures), CRITICAL (data corruption risks, system-breaking configuration issues, complete migration failure)\n- **Log Format Standards**: Structured JSON logs with migration_id (unique identifier propagated across all related log entries), source_version and target_version (configuration schema versions), migration_step (current operation), timestamp (ISO format), file_paths (affected configuration files), error_context (detailed error information), duration_ms (operation timing)\n- **Contextual Information**: Source and target configuration file paths, migration progress percentage, configuration schema versions, Home Assistant core version, addon version, system environment details, user configuration metadata (anonymized), rollback checkpoint data\n- **Integration Requirements**: Home Assistant logging system compatibility with addon logs appearing in HA supervisor logs, centralized log aggregation for migration monitoring, configurable log levels through HA addon configuration, automated log rotation and cleanup, structured log parsing for monitoring systems, integration with HA Repair issues for migration failures\n\n### 3. Enhanced Security Considerations\n- **Continuous Security**: Configuration data exposure during migration process (sensitive API keys, passwords), temporary file security with proper permissions and encryption, backup file encryption and secure storage, protection against configuration injection attacks during migration\n- **Secure Coding Practices**: Encrypted backup storage using HA secrets management, secure file permissions (600) during migration operations, input validation and sanitization for all configuration parameters, secure handling of API keys via HA Supervisor API (never direct file access), temporary file creation using Python tempfile module with secure creation, OWASP secure configuration guidelines compliance\n- **Dependency Vulnerability Scans**: Automated scanning of migration utilities (PyYAML, jsonschema) for known vulnerabilities using safety or bandit tools, regular dependency updates and security patch monitoring, secure configuration parsing libraries, validation of migration tool integrity\n\n### 4. Success Metrics & Performance Baselines\n- **KPIs**: Migration completion rate (target >99%), migration execution time (target <30 seconds for typical configurations), rollback success rate (target 100%), data integrity validation success (target 100%), user satisfaction with migration process measured via post-migration \"Was this migration helpful? [👍/👎]\" feedback (target >90% positive)\n- **Performance Baselines**: Memory usage during migration (<50MB peak), temporary disk space requirements (<100MB), concurrent migration handling (support for multiple users), network bandwidth usage (minimal for local operations), CPU usage impact (<10% system load), testing performance on low-power hardware (Raspberry Pi compatibility)\n- **Benchmarking Strategy**: Before/after migration performance comparison with automated testing, continuous integration migration testing with various configuration sizes, regression detection for migration performance, automated performance alerts for degradation, user experience timing measurements\n\n### 5. Developer Experience & Maintainability\n- **Code Readability**: Clear migration step documentation with inline comments, intuitive function and variable naming, comprehensive migration flow documentation, visual migration process diagrams, standardized code formatting and style guides\n- **Testability**: Migration simulation frameworks for testing without actual file changes, comprehensive rollback testing utilities with various failure scenarios, configuration compatibility test suites covering multiple HA versions, mock frameworks for Home Assistant API integration, automated testing for edge cases and boundary conditions, property-based testing using hypothesis for generating diverse configuration files\n- **Configuration Simplicity**: One-click migration process through HA addon interface, automatic backup creation with user notification, user-friendly progress indicators with clear status messages, simple rollback mechanism through HA interface, clear migration success/failure notifications\n- **Extensibility**: Pluggable migration handlers for future configuration schema changes, version-specific migration modules following migration_vX_to_vY.py naming pattern executed by main runner, future-proof migration architecture supporting multiple source formats, modular design allowing custom migration steps, backward compatibility framework for legacy configurations\n\n### 6. Documentation Strategy (User & Developer)\n- **End-User Documentation**: Step-by-step migration guide with screenshots in HA addon documentation, troubleshooting guide for common migration issues with specific solutions, FAQ section addressing user concerns about data safety, migration checklist with pre-migration preparation steps, post-migration validation instructions, visual state diagram of migration process using Mermaid.js, \"What's Changed?\" summary for users post-migration\n- **Developer Documentation**: Migration architecture documentation with system design diagrams, API documentation for migration interfaces and hooks, README updates with migration development guidelines, code comments explaining complex migration logic, architectural decision records for migration design choices\n- **HA Compliance Documentation**: Home Assistant addon certification checklist with migration-specific requirements, HA configuration schema validation documentation, HA supervisor integration documentation, compliance verification procedures, certification submission guidelines\n- **Operational Documentation**: Migration monitoring procedures with alerting setup, maintenance and troubleshooting runbooks, backup and recovery procedures, performance monitoring guidelines, incident response procedures for migration failures\n\n## Integration with TDD/AAA Pattern\nAll migration components must include comprehensive test coverage following Arrange-Act-Assert methodology with specific migration test scenarios, edge case validation, and rollback verification testing. Each bullet point under 'User-Facing Error Reporting' should correspond to a specific failing test case that validates the error handling behavior.\n\n## MCP Server Integration Requirements\n- **GitHub MCP**: Version control for migration scripts and rollback procedures\n- **WebFetch MCP**: Continuously monitor HA release notes and research latest HA configuration standards and compatibility requirements\n- **zen MCP**: Collaborate on complex migration logic decisions and validation strategies, arbitrate disagreements in migration approach\n- **Task MCP**: Orchestrate migration testing and validation workflows\n\n## Home Assistant Compliance\nFull compliance with HA addon configuration schema requirements, HA supervisor integration standards, and HA security guidelines for configuration management.",

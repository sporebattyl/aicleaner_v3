User-Facing Error Reporting Strategy\n- **Error Classification**: HA Supervisor connection failures (API timeout, authentication issues, permission errors), HA service call errors (invalid service, parameter validation, execution failures), entity registration issues (duplicate entities, invalid device class, state update failures), config flow errors (validation failures, migration issues, setup wizard problems)\n- **Progressive Error Disclosure**: Simple \"Home Assistant connection issue - checking status\" for end users, detailed HA integration status with specific service/entity information for troubleshooting, comprehensive HA API logs with request/response details and timing for developers\n- **Recovery Guidance**: Automatic HA Supervisor reconnection with user notification and progress indicators, step-by-step HA configuration validation with direct links to HA integration troubleshooting documentation, \"Copy HA Integration Details\" button for community support and issue reporting\n- **Error Prevention**: Proactive HA Supervisor health monitoring with early warning alerts, continuous HA service availability checking, automated HA entity state validation, pre-configuration validation for HA compatibility\n\n### 2. Structured Logging Strategy\n- **Log Levels**: DEBUG (HA API request/response details, entity state change tracking, service call parameter logging), INFO (HA Supervisor connection status, entity registration events, config flow progress), WARN (HA version compatibility warnings, service deprecation notices, entity unavailability), ERROR (HA API failures, entity registration failures, service call errors), CRITICAL (HA Supervisor connection lost, complete integration failure, security violations)\n- **Log Format Standards**: Structured JSON logs with ha_integration_id (unique identifier propagated across all HA-related operations), supervisor_api_version, entity_id, service_name, device_id, ha_core_version, integration_status, api_response_time_ms, error_context with detailed HA-specific failure information\n- **Contextual Information**: Home Assistant core version and integration compatibility, HA Supervisor API endpoints and response times, entity registry status and device information, HA service registry and automation integration status, HA configuration validation results\n- **Integration Requirements**: Home Assistant Supervisor logging endpoint integration with structured log forwarding, HA addon log aggregation in Supervisor dashboard, configurable HA integration log levels, automated HA integration reporting, integration with HA system health for addon status monitoring\n\n### 3. Enhanced Security Considerations\n- **Continuous Security**: HA Supervisor API secure communication with proper authentication and authorization, HA addon sandbox compliance with restricted file system and network access, HA secrets management integration for API keys and sensitive configuration, protection against HA service abuse and unauthorized access\n- **Secure Coding Practices**: HA Supervisor API authentication using addon tokens and secure API endpoints, HA secrets integration via Supervisor secrets API (never direct file access), input validation for all HA service calls and entity data, secure entity state handling without sensitive data exposure, OWASP security guidelines compliance for HA addon development\n- **Dependency Vulnerability Scans**: Automated scanning of HA integration libraries (homeassistant, aiohttp, voluptuous) for known vulnerabilities, regular security updates for HA-related dependencies, secure HA API client libraries with proper certificate validation\n\n### 4. Success Metrics & Performance Baselines\n- **KPIs**: HA Supervisor connection uptime (target >99.9%), HA service call response time (target <200ms), entity state update latency (target <100ms), config flow completion rate (target >95%), HA integration user satisfaction measured via post-setup \"Was the HA integration setup helpful? [👍/👎]\" feedback (target >95% positive)\n- **Performance Baselines**: HA API call latency benchmarks across different HA versions, memory usage during HA operations (<150MB per integration), HA entity update throughput (>100 entities/second), config flow completion time (<2 minutes), HA integration performance on low-power hardware (Raspberry Pi compatibility)\n- **Benchmarking Strategy**: Continuous HA integration performance monitoring with automated regression detection, HA service call performance trending analysis, entity update latency tracking with automated alerts, HA compatibility testing across multiple HA versions\n\n### 5. Developer Experience & Maintainability\n- **Code Readability**: Clear HA integration architecture documentation with HA API usage examples, intuitive HA service call patterns with comprehensive error handling, HA entity lifecycle documentation with state management examples, standardized HA integration code formatting following HA development guidelines\n- **Testability**: Comprehensive HA integration testing framework with HA test environment simulation, HA service call mocking utilities for testing without live HA instance, HA entity testing suites with state validation, property-based testing using hypothesis for generating diverse HA scenarios, isolated HA integration testing with docker-compose HA test environments\n- **Configuration Simplicity**: One-click HA integration setup through HA config flow interface, automatic HA version compatibility detection and warnings, user-friendly HA entity configuration with intuitive naming and organization, simple HA automation integration with clear examples and templates\n- **Extensibility**: Pluggable HA service modules for new HA service integrations, extensible HA entity framework supporting custom device classes, modular HA integration architecture following ha_integration_vX naming pattern executed by main HA coordinator, adaptable HA configuration supporting evolving HA capabilities\n\n### 6.

Each HA service call and entity operation should have corresponding tests that validate HA integration behavior through comprehensive HA test environment simulation. HA compatibility should be validated through automated testing across multiple HA versions.\n\n## MCP Server Integration Requirements\n- **GitHub MCP**: Version control for HA integration configurations and HA compatibility tracking with automated HA testing on integration changes\n- **WebFetch MCP**: Continuously monitor HA release notes and research latest HA integration requirements and best practices\n- **zen MCP**: Collaborate on complex HA integration architecture decisions and HA certification strategies, arbitrate disagreements in HA integration approach\n- **Task MCP**: Orchestrate HA integration testing workflows and HA compatibility monitoring automation\n\n## Home Assistant Compliance\nFull compliance with HA addon certification requirements, HA Quality Scale standards, HA Supervisor integration guidelines, HA security requirements, and HA community development best practices.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n- **Required Tools**: homeassistant, aiohttp, voluptuous, pytest-homeassistant-custom-component, hacs-integration\n- **HA Integration**: Supervisor API v2023.06+, Config Flow v2023.06+, Entity Registry v2023.06+\n- **Performance Requirements**: <200ms service calls, <100ms entity updates, >99.9% integration uptime\n- **Certification**: HA Quality Scale compliance, HA addon store certification ready",

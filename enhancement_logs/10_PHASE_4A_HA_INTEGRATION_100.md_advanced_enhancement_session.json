Expect a JSON response with a `status` field indicating the health status (e.g., `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`). A recommended timeout value is 10 seconds. Use `async/await` for non-blocking checks to prevent blocking the main event loop. Example:\n\n         ```python\n         import asyncio\n         import aiohttp\n\n         async def check_supervisor_health(supervisor_url):\n             try:\n                 async with aiohttp.ClientSession(timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=10)) as session:\n                     async with session.get(f\"{supervisor_url}/health\") as response:\n                         response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n                         data = await response.json()\n                         if data.get(\"status\") == \"ok\":\n                             return True\n                         else:\n                             return False\n             except (aiohttp.ClientError, asyncio.TimeoutError) as e:\n                 print(f\"Supervisor health check failed: {e}\")\n                 return False\n\n         async def main():\n             supervisor_url = \"http://supervisor:8080\"  # Replace with your Supervisor URL\n             is_healthy = await check_supervisor_health(supervisor_url)\n             print(f\"Supervisor health status: {is_healthy}\")\n\n         if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n             asyncio.run(main())\n         ```\n   - **Validation**: Supervisor compatibility tests passing, addon lifecycle events properly logged, health check endpoints responding within 500ms\n\n2. **HA Service Call Integration** \n   - **Action**: Develop robust Home Assistant service call framework with automation integration, service discovery, and error handling\n   - **Details**: Service registry implementation, automation trigger/condition integration, service call validation, response handling, state synchronization. Service call validation ensures that the input parameters passed to a service call are valid before the service logic is executed. This prevents errors and ensures the integrity of the system.\n\n     - **Input Parameter Validation**: Implement validation of input parameters for service calls using JSON Schema or custom validation functions.\n\n       - **JSON Schema Validation**: Define JSON Schemas for each service call to specify the expected data types, formats, and constraints for the input parameters. Use a JSON Schema validator library (e.g., `jsonschema` in Python) to validate the input parameters against the schema before executing the service call.\n\n         ```python\n         from jsonschema import validate, ValidationError\n\n         def validate_service_call(service_name, params):\n             schema = {\n                 \"type\": \"object\",\n                 \"properties\": {\n                     \"device_id\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                     \"temperature\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"minimum\": -50, \"maximum\": 100}\n                 },\n                 \"required\": [\"device_id\", \"temperature\"]\n             }\n             try:\n                 validate(instance=params, schema=schema)\n             except ValidationError as e:\n                 return f\"Validation error: {e.message}\"\n             return None\n\n         def set_temperature(device_id, temperature):\n             params = {\"device_id\": device_id, \"temperature\": temperature}\n             validation_error = validate_service_call(\"set_temperature\", params)\n             if validation_error:\n                 return f\"Error: {validation_error}\"\n             # Service logic here\n             return f\"Temperature set to {temperature} for device {device_id}\"\n\n         # Example usage\n         result = set_temperature(\"thermostat_123\", 25)\n         print(result)\n         ```\n\n       - **Custom Validation Functions**: Implement custom validation functions to perform more complex validation logic that cannot be expressed using JSON Schema. These functions can check for specific business rules or constraints.\n\n         ```python\n         def validate_device_id(device_id):\n             if not device_id.startswith(\"device_\"):\n                 return \"Device ID must start with 'device_'\"\n             return None\n\n         def set_temperature(device_id, temperature):\n             device_id_error = validate_device_id(device_id)\n             if device_id_error:\n                 return f\"Error: {device_id_error}\"\n             if not -50 <= temperature <= 100:\n                 return \"Temperature must be between -50 and 100\"\n             # Service logic here\n             return f\"Temperature set to {temperature} for device {device_id}\"\n\n         # Example usage\n         result = set_temperature(\"invalid_device_id\", 25)\n         print(result)\n         result = set_temperature(\"device_123\", 150)\n         print(result)\n         ```\n\n     - **Handling Validation Errors**: When a validation error occurs, return an appropriate error message to the user. This message should clearly indicate the cause of the error and provide guidance on how to correct it. Ensure that the error messages are user-friendly and easy to understand.\n\n       ```json\n       {\n           \"status\": \"error\",\n           \"message\": \"Invalid input parameters: Temperature must be between -50 and 100\"\n       }\n       ```\n   - **Validation**: All HA services accessible and responsive, automation integration functional, service call latency <200ms\n\n3. **Entity Registration & Management**\n   - **Action**: Implement complete entity lifecycle management with device discovery, entity registry integration, and state management\n   - **Details**: Device/entity creation, state updates, attribute management, availability tracking, entity customization support, device class compliance\n   - **Validation**: Entities properly registered in HA, state updates reflected in UI, device information accurate and complete\n\n4. **Config Flow Implementation**\n   - **Action**: Create user-friendly configuration flow with setup wizard, validation, and migration support for seamless user experience\n   - **Details**: Multi-step configuration wizard, input validation, error handling, configuration migration, integration testing\n   - **Validation**: Config flow completes successfully, user inputs validated, migration from legacy configurations functional\n\n## 6-Section 100/100 Enhancement Framework\n\n### 1.

Expect a JSON response with a `status` field indicating the health status (e.g., `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`). A recommended timeout value is 10 seconds. Use `async/await` for non-blocking checks to prevent blocking the main event loop. Example:\n\n         ```python\n         import asyncio\n         import aiohttp\n\n         async def check_supervisor_health(supervisor_url):\n             try:\n                 async with aiohttp.ClientSession(timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=10)) as session:\n                     async with session.get(f\"{supervisor_url}/health\") as response:\n                         response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n                         data = await response.json()\n                         if data.get(\"status\") == \"ok\":\n                             return True\n                         else:\n                             return False\n             except (aiohttp.ClientError, asyncio.TimeoutError) as e:\n                 print(f\"Supervisor health check failed: {e}\")\n                 return False\n\n         async def main():\n             supervisor_url = \"http://supervisor:8080\"  # Replace with your Supervisor URL\n             is_healthy = await check_supervisor_health(supervisor_url)\n             print(f\"Supervisor health status: {is_healthy}\")\n\n         if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n             asyncio.run(main())\n         ```\n   - **Validation**: Supervisor compatibility tests passing, addon lifecycle events properly logged, health check endpoints responding within 500ms\n\n2. **HA Service Call Integration** \n   - **Action**: Develop robust Home Assistant service call framework with automation integration, service discovery, and error handling\n   - **Details**: Service registry implementation, automation trigger/condition integration, service call validation, response handling, state synchronization. Service call validation ensures that the input parameters passed to a service call are valid before the service logic is executed. This prevents errors and ensures the integrity of the system.\n\n     - **Input Parameter Validation**: Implement validation of input parameters for service calls using JSON Schema or custom validation functions.\n\n       - **JSON Schema Validation**: Define JSON Schemas for each service call to specify the expected data types, formats, and constraints for the input parameters. Use a JSON Schema validator library (e.g., `jsonschema` in Python) to validate the input parameters against the schema before executing the service call.\n\n         ```python\n         from jsonschema import validate, ValidationError\n\n         def validate_service_call(service_name, params):\n             schema = {\n                 \"type\": \"object\",\n                 \"properties\": {\n                     \"device_id\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                     \"temperature\": {\"type\": \"number\", \"minimum\": -50, \"maximum\": 100}\n                 },\n                 \"required\": [\"device_id\", \"temperature\"]\n             }\n             try:\n                 validate(instance=params, schema=schema)\n             except ValidationError as e:\n                 return f\"Validation error: {e.message}\"\n             return None\n\n         def set_temperature(device_id, temperature):\n             params = {\"device_id\": device_id, \"temperature\": temperature}\n             validation_error = validate_service_call(\"set_temperature\", params)\n             if validation_error:\n                 return f\"Error: {validation_error}\"\n             # Service logic here\n             return f\"Temperature set to {temperature} for device {device_id}\"\n\n         # Example usage\n         result = set_temperature(\"thermostat_123\", 25)\n         print(result)\n         ```\n\n       - **Custom Validation Functions**: Implement custom validation functions to perform more complex validation logic that cannot be expressed using JSON Schema. These functions can check for specific business rules or constraints.\n\n         ```python\n         def validate_device_id(device_id):\n             if not device_id.startswith(\"device_\"):\n                 return \"Device ID must start with 'device_'\"\n             return None\n\n         def set_temperature(device_id, temperature):\n             device_id_error = validate_device_id(device_id)\n             if device_id_error:\n                 return f\"Error: {device_id_error}\"\n             if not -50 <= temperature <= 100:\n                 return \"Temperature must be between -50 and 100\"\n             # Service logic here\n             return f\"Temperature set to {temperature} for device {device_id}\"\n\n         # Example usage\n         result = set_temperature(\"invalid_device_id\", 25)\n         print(result)\n         result = set_temperature(\"device_123\", 150)\n         print(result)\n         ```\n\n     - **Handling Validation Errors**: When a validation error occurs, return an appropriate error message to the user. This message should clearly indicate the cause of the error and provide guidance on how to correct it. Ensure that the error messages are user-friendly and easy to understand.\n\n       ```json\n       {\n           \"status\": \"error\",\n           \"message\": \"Invalid input parameters: Temperature must be between -50 and 100\"\n       }\n       ```\n   - **Validation**: All HA services accessible and responsive, automation integration functional, service call latency <200ms\n\n3. **Entity Registration & Management**\n   - **Action**: Implement complete entity lifecycle management with device discovery, entity registry integration, and state management\n   - **Details**: Device/entity creation, state updates, attribute management, availability tracking, entity customization support, device class compliance\n   - **Validation**: Entities properly registered in HA, state updates reflected in UI, device information accurate and complete\n\n4. **Config Flow Implementation**\n   - **Action**: Create user-friendly configuration flow with setup wizard, validation, and migration support for seamless user experience\n   - **Details**: Multi-step configuration wizard, input validation, error handling, configuration migration, integration testing\n   - **Validation**: Config flow completes successfully, user inputs validated, migration from legacy configurations functional\n\n## 6-Section 100/100 Enhancement Framework\n\n### 1.

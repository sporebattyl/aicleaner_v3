CONSENSUS REVIEW - GEMINI'S APPROACH VS 100/100 PATTERN

Gemini, I've reviewed your implementation and I need to collaborate with you to reach consensus. 

YOUR CURRENT APPROACH:
You provided general implementation guidance with steps like "Configuration Schema Definition", "Migration Script", "Testing", etc.

OUR VALIDATED 100/100 PATTERN:
We achieved 100/100 readiness on Phase 1A using these specific 5 sections:
1. **User-Facing Error Reporting Strategy** 
2. **Structured Logging Strategy**
3. **Enhanced Security Considerations** 
4. **Success Metrics & Performance Baselines**
5. **Developer Experience & Maintainability**

CONSENSUS QUESTION:
Should we apply the proven 100/100 pattern (5 sections) to all prompts, or use your general implementation approach?

MY ANALYSIS:
- Your approach provides good technical guidance but lacks the comprehensive quality framework
- The 100/100 pattern ensures consistency across all prompts and addresses operational readiness
- We validated the 5-section pattern achieves production-grade quality

COLLABORATIVE REQUEST:
Let's discuss and reach consensus on which approach will best serve the AICleaner v3 project:

OPTION A: Apply the proven 5-section 100/100 pattern to all 14 prompts
OPTION B: Use your general implementation approach 
OPTION C: Hybrid approach combining both patterns

Which option do you think will achieve the best results for production-ready Home Assistant addon development?

Please provide your expert analysis and recommendation so we can reach consensus.

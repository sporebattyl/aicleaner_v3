COLLABORATION REQUEST - COMPLETE PHASE 3A IMPLEMENTATION

Gemini, thank you for the initial Phase 3A diff. I need to collaborate with you to get the complete implementation following our exact 6-section 100/100 pattern.

WHAT I NEED: Complete Phase 3A: Device Detection Enhancement with all 6 sections:

1. **User-Facing Error Reporting Strategy** (device detection specific errors)
2. **Structured Logging Strategy** (device detection logging)  
3. **Enhanced Security Considerations** (device detection security)
4. **Success Metrics & Performance Baselines** (device detection KPIs)
5. **Developer Experience & Maintainability** (device detection development)
6. **Documentation Strategy** (device detection documentation)

SPECIFIC REQUEST: Please provide the complete Phase 3A implementation with:
- All 6 sections fully detailed with device detection specific content
- Each section should have 4 subsections (like Error Classification, Progressive Error Disclosure, etc.)
- Technical specifications for device detection frameworks
- MCP integration requirements  
- HA compliance for device detection

COLLABORATION: Do you agree we should include these device detection specific elements:
- Multi-protocol device discovery (Zeroconf, mDNS, SSDP, Bluetooth LE)
- Device fingerprinting and capability analysis
- Real-time device state monitoring
- Automated device onboarding workflows
- Device compatibility assessment

Please provide the complete 6-section implementation or let me know what adjustments you think we should make to achieve the best device detection enhancement approach.

DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION - CONTENT ONLY

Gemini, I need only the actual diff content, not thinking process or analysis. Please provide exactly this format:

=== PHASE_1B_CONFIGURATION_MIGRATION_ENHANCEMENT.diff ===

### User-Facing Error Reporting Strategy
- **Error Classification**: Configuration migration failures, version incompatibility errors, data corruption detection, backup restoration issues
- **Progressive Error Disclosure**: Simple "Migration failed" message for users, detailed version compatibility info for troubleshooting, full error logs for developers  
- **Recovery Guidance**: Step-by-step rollback to previous configuration, manual migration instructions, automated recovery options
- **Error Prevention**: Pre-migration validation checks, compatibility testing, backup verification before migration

### Structured Logging Strategy  
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG (migration step details), INFO (migration progress milestones), WARN (compatibility warnings), ERROR (migration failures), CRITICAL (data corruption risks)
- **Log Format Standards**: JSON logs with migration_id, source_version, target_version, step_progress, timestamp, error_context
- **Contextual Information**: Configuration file paths, migration duration, data size metrics, rollback checkpoint data
- **Integration Requirements**: Home Assistant migration log aggregation, automated migration reporting, progress tracking

### Enhanced Security Considerations
- **Continuous Security**: Configuration data exposure during migration, temporary file security, backup encryption
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Encrypted backup storage, secure file permissions during migration, input validation for migration parameters
- **Dependency Vulnerability Scans**: Migration utility security scanning, backup tool vulnerability assessment

### Success Metrics & Performance Baselines
- **KPIs**: Migration completion rate (>95%), migration time (<30 seconds), rollback success rate (100%), data integrity validation (100%)
- **Performance Baselines**: Memory usage during migration (<50MB), disk space requirements (<100MB temporary), concurrent migration handling
- **Benchmarking Strategy**: Before/after migration performance comparison, automated migration testing, regression detection

### Developer Experience & Maintainability
- **Code Readability**: Migration step documentation, clear error messaging, intuitive rollback procedures
- **Testability**: Migration simulation frameworks, rollback testing utilities, compatibility test suites
- **Configuration Simplicity**: One-click migration process, automatic backup creation, user-friendly progress indicators
- **Extensibility**: Pluggable migration handlers, version-specific migration modules, future-proof migration architecture

PHASE 1A ENHANCEMENT DIFF GENERATION

Gemini, I need you to create a detailed diff to enhance Phase 1A Configuration Consolidation from 92/100 to 98/100 readiness using our consensus template improvements.

CURRENT FILE: PHASE_1A_CONFIGURATION_CONSOLIDATION_ENHANCED.md (already at 92/100)
TARGET: Apply 98+ template enhancements to reach 98/100

REQUIRED ENHANCEMENTS:
1. **Dependency & Data Contracts** section
2. **Success Metrics & Performance Baselines** section  
3. **Continuous Security Considerations** section
4. **Developer Experience & Maintainability** section

DIFF REQUEST:
Please provide a precise diff in standard format showing:

```diff
--- PHASE_1A_CONFIGURATION_CONSOLIDATION_ENHANCED.md (current 92/100)
+++ PHASE_1A_CONFIGURATION_CONSOLIDATION_98PLUS.md (enhanced 98/100)
@@ -line,count +line,count @@
- [content to remove/modify]
+ [content to add/enhance]
```

REQUIREMENTS:
- Show exact line numbers and modifications
- Add the 4 consensus enhancement sections in appropriate locations
- Maintain all existing 92/100 content 
- Focus on practical, implementable additions
- Ensure enhancements align with configuration consolidation objectives

Please generate the complete diff for Phase 1A enhancement.

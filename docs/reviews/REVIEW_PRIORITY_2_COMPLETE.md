# Priority 2 Implementation Review - User-Facing Features Complete

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed Priority 2 implementation for AICleaner Phase 3C.2, implementing comprehensive user-facing health monitoring features in Home Assistant:

1. **Health Check Service** - 30-second comprehensive system health assessment with weighted scoring
2. **Home Assistant Integration** - Three new sensor entities with real-time health metrics
3. **Service Registration** - Two new HA services with proper UI integration
4. **Dual-Mode Alerting** - Intelligent alert categorization with appropriate notification strategies

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Health Check Service & Score Calculation

**Created:** `core/system_monitor.py` - Enhanced with health check functionality

The health check service performs a comprehensive 30-second assessment calculating a Health Score (0-100) using the agreed-upon weighted average:

**Health Score Calculation:**
```python
def _calculate_health_score(self, avg_response_time: float, error_rate: float,
                           resource_pressure: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate health score (0-100) using weighted average.

    Weights:
    - Average Inference Latency: 60%
    - Error Rate: 30%
    - Resource Pressure: 10%
    """
    # Normalize latency score (lower is better)
    # Assume 500ms is baseline good, 2000ms is poor
    latency_score = max(0, min(100, 100 - ((avg_response_time - 500) / 15)))

    # Normalize error rate score (lower is better)
    error_score = max(0, 100 - (error_rate * 100))

    # Normalize resource pressure score (lower is better)
    resource_score = max(0, 100 - (resource_pressure * 100))

    # Calculate weighted average
    health_score = (
        latency_score * 0.60 +    # 60% weight
        error_score * 0.30 +      # 30% weight
        resource_score * 0.10     # 10% weight
    )

    return max(0, min(100, health_score))
```

**Key Features:**
- Tests AI inference every 2 seconds during the check period
- Uses representative prompt: "Analyze this room for cleaning tasks. Focus on identifying items that need attention."
- Measures actual response times and error rates
- Calculates real-time resource pressure from CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Supports multiple AI client types (Gemini, Ollama, MultiModelAI)

### 2. Home Assistant Sensor Entities

**Created:** `core/health_entities.py` - Complete entity management system

**Three New Sensor Entities:**

#### sensor.aicleaner_health_score
- **Unit:** score (0-100)
- **State Class:** measurement
- **Icon:** mdi:heart-pulse
- **Attributes:** test_duration, total_tests, successful_tests, failed_tests

#### sensor.aicleaner_average_response_time
- **Unit:** ms
- **State Class:** measurement
- **Icon:** mdi:timer
- **Attributes:** min_response_time, max_response_time, error_rate, resource_pressure

#### binary_sensor.aicleaner_health_alert
- **Device Class:** problem
- **Icon:** mdi:alert-circle
- **States:** on/off based on performance warnings
- **Attributes:** reason, performance_warnings, critical_alerts, warning_count

### 3. Home Assistant Service Registration

**Enhanced:** `utils/services.yaml` - Added new service definitions

**Two New Services:**

#### aicleaner.run_health_check
```yaml
run_health_check:
  name: "Run Health Check"
  description: "Run a comprehensive 30-second system health check and update health sensors"
  fields:
    duration:
      description: "Duration of the health check in seconds"
      example: 30
      default: 30
      required: false
      selector:
        number:
          min: 10
          max: 120
          step: 5
          unit_of_measurement: "seconds"
```

#### aicleaner.apply_performance_profile
```yaml
apply_performance_profile:
  name: "Apply Performance Profile"
  description: "Change the active performance profile (requires restart to take effect)"
  fields:
    profile:
      description: "Performance profile to apply"
      example: "balanced"
      required: true
      selector:
        select:
          options:
            - "auto"
            - "resource_efficient"
            - "balanced"
            - "maximum_performance"
```

### 4. Dual-Mode Alerting Strategy

**Implementation:** Enhanced alert categorization in `SystemMonitor`

**Alert Categories:**

#### Critical Alerts (Persistent HA Notifications)
- System health severely degraded (< 30 score)
- Critical resource pressure (> 90%)
- Monitoring components unavailable
- System monitoring not active
- AI services completely offline

**Example Critical Alert Notification:**
```python
await self.ha_client.send_notification(
    title="ðŸš¨ AICleaner Critical Alert",
    message=f"Critical system issues detected: {alert_summary}. "
           f"Health Score: {health_result.health_score:.1f}/100. "
           f"Immediate attention required.",
    data={
        "priority": "high",
        "persistent": True,
        "tag": "aicleaner_critical"
    }
)
```

#### Performance Warnings (Binary Sensor Only)
- Health score below optimal (< 60)
- Elevated response times (> 1000ms)
- Elevated error rates (> 10%)
- High resource pressure (> 80%)

**Example Binary Sensor State:**
```python
# State: "on" when performance warnings exist
attributes = {
    "reason": "Elevated response time: 1250ms; High resource pressure detected",
    "performance_warnings": [
        "Elevated response time: 1250ms",
        "High resource pressure detected"
    ],
    "warning_count": 2,
    "health_score": 72.5
}
```

# Handoff to Next Agent

## Current Status
The core refactoring for Phase 1A of the AI Cleaner addon is underway. The codebase has been significantly reorganized to improve modularity and maintainability. Key changes include:

*   **Directory Structure:** Python files from the root directory have been moved into new, functional subdirectories within `addons/aicleaner_v3/` (e.g., `ai/`, `notifications/`, `rules/`, `utils/`, `mobile/`, `mqtt/`, `gamification/`).
*   **Duplicate File Removal:** Redundant files like `gemini_client.py`, `ha_client.py`, and `mqtt_manager.py` were removed from `addons/aicleaner_v3/core/` as they now reside in `addons/aicleaner_v3/integrations/`.
*   **Asynchronous Client Updates:**
    *   `HAClient` (`integrations/ha_client.py`) has been updated to use `aiohttp` for asynchronous operations and now requires `api_url` and `token` during initialization.
    *   `GeminiClient` (`integrations/gemini_client.py`) includes an asynchronous `analyze_image` method and a `shutdown` method.
*   **Core Component Refactoring:**
    *   The monolithic `Zone` class functionality has been migrated into `ZoneManager` within `addons/aicleaner_v3/core/analyzer.py`.
    *   `StateManager` (`addons/aicleaner_v3/core/state_manager.py`) has been enhanced to support the 9-state progression and comprehensive task/cleanliness data management.
    *   `PerformanceMonitor` (`addons/aicleaner_v3/core/performance_monitor.py`) now correctly uses `HAClient` for sensor updates.
    *   `ZoneScheduler` (`addons/aicleaner_v3/core/scheduler.py`) has been updated to remove its direct dependency on `state_manager`.
*   **Main Application (`AICleaner`):** The `AICleaner` class (`addons/aicleaner_v3/aicleaner.py`) has been updated to correctly initialize and inject dependencies into the refactored components, including passing `config` to `StateManager` and `ha_api_url`/`ha_access_token` to `HAClient`.
*   **Cleanup:** Backup files (`.backup`) and `__pycache__` directories have been removed from the codebase.

**Outstanding Issue:** There is a persistent `SyntaxError` in `addons/aicleaner_v3/core/analyzer.py` related to multi-line string formatting within the `_format_batch_analysis_prompt` method. This issue needs to be resolved before tests can pass reliably.

## Next Steps for the Next Agent

1.  **Resolve `SyntaxError` in `addons/aicleaner_v3/core/analyzer.py`:**
    *   The `SyntaxError` is likely due to incorrect handling of multi-line f-strings or triple-quoted strings within the `_format_batch_analysis_prompt` method.
    *   Carefully inspect the `_format_batch_analysis_prompt` method in `addons/aicleaner_v3/core/analyzer.py`.
    *   Rewrite the multi-line string concatenation in this method to ensure proper syntax and avoid the `SyntaxError`. Using explicit string concatenation (`+`) or ensuring correct f-string usage with triple quotes is crucial.

2.  **Run and Pass All Tests:**
    *   After resolving the `SyntaxError`, run all existing tests in the `addons/aicleaner_v3/tests/` directory.
    *   Ensure all tests pass, especially `test_analyzer.py` and `test_state_manager.py`.
    *   If any tests fail, debug and fix the issues.

3.  **Continue Phase 1A Implementation:**
    *   Once all tests pass, continue with the remaining tasks for Phase 1A as outlined in `projectdesign.md`.
    *   This includes further integration of `ignore_rules_manager` and `notification_engine` into `ZoneManager` as needed, and ensuring all existing functionality from the original `aicleaner.py` (now deleted from the root) is preserved and correctly implemented within the new modular structure.

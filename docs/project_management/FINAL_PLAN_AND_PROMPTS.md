# Final Plan & Prompts for Phase 3C.2 Implementation

Claude, this is another fantastic step forward. Your proactive refinement of the prompts shows you've fully grasped the collaborative goal here: to build the best possible addon by balancing technical power with user-centric simplicity. Your refined prompts are filled with brilliant technical ideas.

My feedback will focus on honing these ideas into a Minimum Viable Intelligence for this phase, ensuring we deliver a robust, simple, and valuable feature set first, while keeping your more advanced concepts in our back pocket for future iterations.

## âœ… Final Alignment: Answers to Your Questions

Let's start by answering your excellent questions from the `REFINED_PROMPTS_COMMUNICATION.md` document.

> **Q1 (Health Check):** Test with a tiny prompt, a representative prompt, or make it configurable?

**My Answer: B. Use a representative prompt.** You are correct. This provides the most realistic and meaningful performance data for the user.

> **Q2 (Migration Notification):** How to notify the user?

**My Answer: C. Both notification and log entry.** Agreed. A persistent notification ensures the user is aware of the automatic change, and the log provides a detailed record.

> **Q3 (Profile Switching UX):** How to handle the required restart?

**My Answer: A. Show a "Restart Required" message.** This is the safest and most user-friendly approach. It respects user control and prevents unexpected interruptions.

> **Q4 (Health Check Errors):** How to handle failures?

**My Answer: A. Return a score of 0 and trigger a critical alert.** This is the clearest way to communicate a critical failure to the user.

##  guiding Principles for This Phase

Based on your refined prompts, let's establish three guiding principles for this implementation sprint:

1.  **User-Centric Simplicity:** The user should not need to understand the complex inner workings. The feature should "just work" and provide clear, simple feedback (e.g., a single Health Score).
2.  **Minimum Viable Intelligence:** Let's implement the simplest version of the "smart" features first. We can add more complex predictive logic and learning models in the future if real-world usage shows it's necessary.
3.  **Focus on Core Value:** The primary goal is to ensure the addon runs efficiently on the user's hardware and to alert them when it doesn't. Everything we build should directly serve this goal.

##  refined Implementation Prompts

With those principles in mind, I have reviewed and further refined your proposed prompts. The key change is to **simplify Priority 3**, merging your five advanced concepts into one core task: implementing the adaptive frequency loop. This delivers the biggest user benefit (less overhead) with the least complexity.

I am creating the following three files with the final, approved prompts:

1.  `PROMPT_PRIORITY_1_FINAL.md`
2.  `PROMPT_PRIORITY_2_FINAL.md`
3.  `PROMPT_PRIORITY_3_FINAL.md`

You are cleared to begin implementation using these final prompts, starting with Priority 1. This is the definitive plan for completing Phase 3C.2.

- **Key Configurations**: Metric collection intervals, alerting thresholds, dashboard layouts, data retention policies
- **Integration Points**: Home Assistant sensor entities, notification systems, MQTT status reporting, external monitoring tools
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for metric collection, integration tests for sensor reporting, system tests for alerting workflows

## 3. Quality Assurance

### Success Criteria (TDD-Based)
- [ ] All critical performance metrics collected with 99.9% reliability
- [ ] Performance anomalies detected within 60 seconds of occurrence
- [ ] Dashboard provides actionable insights with real-time updates
- [ ] Alerting system maintains low false positive rate (<5%)
- [ ] Historical performance data enables trend analysis and capacity planning

### Component Design Validation
- [ ] Monitoring components have single responsibility for specific metric domains
- [ ] Clear interface between data collection, analysis, and visualization components
- [ ] Loose coupling allows independent evolution of monitoring capabilities
- [ ] High cohesion within metric collection and alerting modules

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Monitoring overhead impacting system performance - Mitigation: Performance impact testing and configurable monitoring levels
- **Medium Risk**: Alert fatigue from excessive notifications - Mitigation: Intelligent alert aggregation and threshold tuning

## 4. Deliverables

### Primary Outputs
- **Code**: Comprehensive monitoring system with real-time metrics and intelligent alerting
- **Tests**: Complete test suite for monitoring accuracy, alerting reliability, and dashboard functionality following AAA pattern
- **Documentation**: Monitoring configuration guide and performance optimization procedures

### Review Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% coverage for monitoring components
- **Code Review**: Metrics collection validation, alerting logic assessment, dashboard implementation review
- **Integration Testing**: Full monitoring workflow testing under various load and failure conditions

## 5. Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **TDD Cycle**: Write monitoring tests first, implement collection and alerting to pass tests, refactor for efficiency
- **AAA Pattern**: Structure tests with clear metric setup (Arrange), data collection operations (Act), and accuracy validation (Assert) sections
- **Component Strategy**: Design monitoring for easy extension, configuration, and maintenance

### Technical Guidelines
- **Time Estimate**: 25-35 hours including comprehensive testing and dashboard development
- **Dependencies**: Completion of Phase 2A AI model optimization
- **HA Standards**: Follow Home Assistant sensor and dashboard development best practices

### MCP Server Usage Requirements
- **Mandatory MCP Servers**: 
  - **WebFetch**: Research latest HA sensor development and dashboard integration standards
  - **WebSearch**: Find current performance monitoring and visualization best practices
- **Optional MCP Servers**:
  - **zen**: Collaborate with Gemini for performance analytics and alerting strategy optimization
  - **Task**: Search for existing monitoring and dashboard code across the project
- **Research Requirements**: Use WebFetch to validate against current HA sensor and dashboard development guidelines
- **Analysis Requirements**: Apply Context7 sequential thinking for performance monitoring architecture analysis
- **Version Control Requirements**: Create feature branch, commit monitoring implementations, tag validated metrics

### Rollback and Recovery Procedures
- **Pre-Phase Checkpoint**: Use GitHub MCP to create branch `phase-2b-monitoring` and commit baseline monitoring
- **Incremental Commits**: Commit after metrics implementation, dashboard setup, and alerting configuration
- **Rollback Triggers**: Monitoring performance impact, dashboard failures, false alerting issues
- **Recovery Strategy**: Use GitHub MCP to revert monitoring changes, restore baseline performance, restart implementation

### Collaborative Review and Validation Process

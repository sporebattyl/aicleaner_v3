  - Implement object tracking across multiple analyses
- âœ… **Context-Aware Task Generation**:
  - Use scene context to prioritize tasks (e.g., dishes before guests arrive)
  - Implement seasonal task adjustments (e.g., more frequent floor cleaning in winter)
  - Add time-sensitive task detection (e.g., food items that need immediate attention)
- âœ… **Integration Points**:
  - Enhance `ZoneManager.process_batch_analysis_results()` to use contextual insights
  - Add scene context to analysis state for better task generation

### 3.4. New Integration Layer: AI Coordinator

**Create**: `ai/ai_coordinator.py`

# Priority 3: Adaptive Monitoring - REFINED

## Context

You are implementing Priority 3 of the Phase 3C.2 performance optimization refinement for AICleaner. This is the **final piece** of our collaborative implementation that completes the transformation from complex technical system to intelligent, user-friendly performance optimization.

**Final Implementation Context:** Upon completion of this priority, we will have achieved our goal of creating a system that intelligently adapts to user needs while maintaining full technical capability behind a simplified interface.

## Objective

Implement intelligent adaptive monitoring that automatically adjusts monitoring frequency and intensity based on system stability, reducing overhead on stable systems while increasing vigilance during periods of instability.

## Implementation Requirements

### Task 3.1: Implement Adaptive Frequency Control

**Action:** Create intelligent monitoring that adapts frequency based on system stability.

**Core Algorithm:**
```python
class AdaptiveMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self._check_frequency = 60  # Start with 60-second intervals
        self._stability_counter = 0
        self._last_anomaly_time = 0
        self._min_frequency = 30   # Never check more than every 30 seconds
        self._max_frequency = 300  # Never check less than every 5 minutes
        
    async def _adaptive_monitoring_loop(self):
        """Intelligent monitoring that adapts to system stability."""
        
        while self.monitoring_active:
            try:
                # Collect current metrics
                current_metrics = await self._collect_metrics()
                
                # Analyze stability
                is_stable = self._analyze_stability(current_metrics)
                
                if is_stable:
                    self._stability_counter += 1
                    # Gradually reduce frequency if stable (less overhead)
                    if self._stability_counter > 10:  # 10 stable cycles
                        self._check_frequency = min(
                            self._max_frequency, 
                            self._check_frequency * 1.2
                        )
                else:
                    self._stability_counter = 0
                    self._last_anomaly_time = time.time()
                    # Increase frequency during instability (more vigilance)
                    self._check_frequency = max(
                        self._min_frequency, 
                        self._check_frequency * 0.8
                    )
                
                # Log frequency changes for debugging
                if self._check_frequency != self._previous_frequency:
                    self.logger.debug(
                        f"Adaptive monitoring: frequency changed to {self._check_frequency}s "
                        f"(stable: {is_stable}, counter: {self._stability_counter})"
                    )
                    self._previous_frequency = self._check_frequency
                
                # Wait for next check
                await asyncio.sleep(self._check_frequency)
                
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f"Error in adaptive monitoring: {e}")
                await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Fallback interval
```

### Task 3.2: Implement Stability Analysis

**Action:** Create sophisticated stability detection that considers multiple factors.

**Stability Metrics:**
```python
def _analyze_stability(self, current_metrics: Dict[str, float]) -> bool:
    """
    Analyze system stability using multiple factors.
    
    Returns True if system is stable, False if unstable.
    """
    stability_factors = []
    
    # Factor 1: Response time stability (40% weight)
    if len(self._response_time_history) >= 5:
        recent_times = self._response_time_history[-5:]
        time_variance = statistics.variance(recent_times)
        time_stability = time_variance < 0.1  # Low variance = stable
        stability_factors.append((time_stability, 0.4))
    
    # Factor 2: Resource usage stability (30% weight)
    cpu_stable = abs(current_metrics.get("cpu_percent", 0) - self._baseline_cpu) < 10
    memory_stable = abs(current_metrics.get("memory_percent", 0) - self._baseline_memory) < 5
    resource_stability = cpu_stable and memory_stable
    stability_factors.append((resource_stability, 0.3))
    
    # Factor 3: Error rate stability (20% weight)
    recent_error_rate = self._calculate_recent_error_rate()
    error_stability = recent_error_rate < 0.05  # Less than 5% errors
    stability_factors.append((error_stability, 0.2))
    
    # Factor 4: Time since last anomaly (10% weight)
    time_since_anomaly = time.time() - self._last_anomaly_time
    time_stability = time_since_anomaly > 300  # 5 minutes since last issue
    stability_factors.append((time_stability, 0.1))
    
    # Calculate weighted stability score
    stability_score = sum(
        (1.0 if stable else 0.0) * weight 
        for stable, weight in stability_factors
    )
    
    # System is stable if score > 0.7 (70% of factors indicate stability)
    return stability_score > 0.7
```

### Task 3.3: Implement Resource-Aware Monitoring

**Action:** Adjust monitoring intensity based on available system resources.

**Resource-Aware Logic:**
```python
async def _adjust_monitoring_for_resources(self):
    """Adjust monitoring based on current resource availability."""
    
    current_resources = await self._get_current_resource_usage()
    
    # If system is under high load, reduce monitoring overhead
    if (current_resources["cpu_percent"] > 85 or 
        current_resources["memory_percent"] > 90):
        
        # Reduce monitoring intensity
        self._monitoring_intensity = "light"
        self._check_frequency = max(self._check_frequency, 120)  # At least 2 minutes
        
        self.logger.info("High resource usage detected - reducing monitoring intensity")
        
    elif (current_resources["cpu_percent"] < 50 and 
          current_resources["memory_percent"] < 70):
        
        # System has resources available - can monitor more frequently
        self._monitoring_intensity = "normal"
        
    else:
        # Moderate resource usage - balanced monitoring
        self._monitoring_intensity = "balanced"
```

### Task 3.4: Implement Predictive Anomaly Detection

**Action:** Use historical data to predict and prevent issues before they become critical.

**Predictive Logic:**
```python
class PredictiveAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self._trend_window = 20  # Analyze last 20 data points
        self._prediction_threshold = 0.8  # 80% confidence for predictions
        
    async def analyze_trends_and_predict(self, metrics_history: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Analyze trends and predict potential issues."""
        
        if len(metrics_history) < self._trend_window:
            return {"prediction": "insufficient_data"}
        
        recent_metrics = metrics_history[-self._trend_window:]
        
        # Analyze response time trend
        response_times = [m.get("avg_response_time", 0) for m in recent_metrics]
        response_trend = self._calculate_trend(response_times)
        
        # Analyze resource usage trends
        cpu_usage = [m.get("cpu_percent", 0) for m in recent_metrics]
        cpu_trend = self._calculate_trend(cpu_usage)
        
        memory_usage = [m.get("memory_percent", 0) for m in recent_metrics]
        memory_trend = self._calculate_trend(memory_usage)
        
        # Generate predictions
        predictions = {}
        
        # Predict response time issues
        if response_trend["slope"] > 0.1 and response_trend["confidence"] > self._prediction_threshold:
            predictions["response_time_degradation"] = {
                "probability": response_trend["confidence"],
                "estimated_time_to_critical": self._estimate_time_to_threshold(
                    response_times, threshold=5000  # 5 second threshold
                ),
                "recommendation": "Consider applying resource_efficient profile"
            }
        
        # Predict resource exhaustion
        if memory_trend["slope"] > 2 and memory_trend["confidence"] > self._prediction_threshold:
            predictions["memory_exhaustion"] = {
                "probability": memory_trend["confidence"],
                "estimated_time_to_critical": self._estimate_time_to_threshold(
                    memory_usage, threshold=95  # 95% memory usage
                ),
                "recommendation": "Reduce context window size or enable memory optimization"
            }
        
        return {

            )
        }
```

### Task 3.5: Implement Smart Alert Escalation

**Action:** Create intelligent alert escalation that learns from user responses.

**Smart Escalation Logic:**
```python
class SmartAlertEscalation:
    def __init__(self):
        self._alert_history = defaultdict(list)
        self._user_response_patterns = defaultdict(float)
        
    async def should_escalate_alert(self, alert_type: str, current_severity: str) -> bool:
        """Determine if alert should be escalated based on patterns."""
        
        # Check alert frequency
        recent_alerts = [
            alert for alert in self._alert_history[alert_type]
            if time.time() - alert["timestamp"] < 3600  # Last hour
        ]
        
        # If too many similar alerts, reduce sensitivity
        if len(recent_alerts) > 3:
            return False
        
        # Check user response patterns
        user_attention_score = self._user_response_patterns.get(alert_type, 0.5)
        
        # If user typically ignores this type of alert, be more selective
        if user_attention_score < 0.3:
            return current_severity == "critical"
        
        # If user typically responds, be more proactive
        if user_attention_score > 0.7:
            return current_severity in ["warning", "critical"]
        
        # Default behavior for unknown patterns
        return current_severity == "critical"
```

- [ ] Clear interface between compliance validation and functionality implementation
- [ ] Loose coupling allows independent compliance updates without affecting core features
- [ ] High cohesion within certification and compliance validation modules

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Certification failure blocking store submission - Mitigation: Incremental compliance validation throughout development
- **Medium Risk**: Compliance requirements changing during development - Mitigation: Regular requirement review and adaptive implementation

## 4. Deliverables

### Primary Outputs
- **Compliance Report**: Comprehensive certification compliance validation report
- **Tests**: Complete certification test suite validating all requirements following AAA pattern
- **Documentation**: Certification submission package with all required documentation

### Review Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: 100% coverage for certification requirements
- **Code Review**: Compliance implementation validation, certification requirement assessment
- **Integration Testing**: Full certification workflow testing with store submission simulation

## 5. Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **TDD Cycle**: Write certification tests first, implement compliance to pass tests, refactor for certification excellence
- **AAA Pattern**: Structure tests with clear compliance setup (Arrange), validation operations (Act), and requirement verification (Assert)
- **Component Strategy**: Design certification system for continuous compliance monitoring and validation

### Technical Guidelines
- **Time Estimate**: Ongoing validation throughout all phases (5-10 hours total)
- **Dependencies**: Applies to all implementation phases
- **HA Standards**: Follow current Home Assistant addon certification and store submission guidelines

### MCP Server Usage Requirements
- **Mandatory MCP Servers**: 
  - **WebFetch**: **CRITICAL** - Continuously research latest HA addon store requirements and certification standards
  - **WebSearch**: Find current compliance tools and certification validation frameworks
- **Optional MCP Servers**:
  - **zen**: Collaborate with Gemini for certification strategy optimization and compliance validation
  - **Task**: Search for compliance-related configurations and standards across the project
- **Research Requirements**: Use WebFetch to validate against current HA certification requirements and store submission guidelines
- **Analysis Requirements**: Apply Context7 sequential thinking for comprehensive certification compliance strategy
- **Version Control Requirements**: Continuous compliance tracking, commit certification fixes, tag compliance-validated states

### Rollback and Recovery Procedures
- **Pre-Phase Checkpoint**: Use GitHub MCP to create compliance tracking branch and commit compliance baseline
- **Incremental Commits**: Commit after each compliance fix, certification requirement implementation, and validation
- **Rollback Triggers**: Certification failures, compliance breaking changes, store submission rejections
- **Recovery Strategy**: Use GitHub MCP to revert to last compliant state, restore certification requirements, restart compliance work

### Collaborative Review and Validation Process
- **Initial Implementation**: Complete all certification requirements validation and compliance verification
- **Gemini Review Request**: Use zen MCP to request comprehensive review of certification readiness and compliance completeness
- **Iterative Refinement**: Collaborate with Gemini to address compliance gaps and enhance certification quality
- **Final Consensus**: Achieve agreement that addon meets all certification requirements and is ready for store submission

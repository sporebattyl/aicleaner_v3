# Phase 1A: Configuration Schema Consolidation - Final 99/100 Readiness

## 1. Context & Objective
- **Primary Goal**: Consolidate three separate configuration files into a unified, validated schema that eliminates redundancy and conflicts while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Phase Context**: This is the critical foundation step of Phase 1 that all subsequent improvements depend on - configuration clarity is essential for reliable addon operation
- **Success Impact**: Enables streamlined configuration management, reduces user confusion, and provides solid base for AI model management enhancements in Phase 2

## 2. Implementation Requirements

### Core Tasks
1. **Configuration Schema Analysis and Mapping**
   - **Action**: Analyze and map all configuration keys across three config files to identify overlaps, conflicts, and dependencies
   - **Details**: Create comprehensive mapping with TDD approach using configuration validation tests and clear component interface contracts for schema handling
   - **Validation**: Write failing tests using AAA pattern that verify schema completeness, then implement schema validation to pass tests

2. **Unified Schema Design with Interface Contracts**
   - **Action**: Design single, authoritative configuration schema with clear component interfaces and validation rules
   - **Details**: Create modular configuration components (AI settings, zone configs, performance settings) with proper type validation, default values, and stable interface contracts
   - **Validation**: Implement schema validation tests using AAA pattern with comprehensive edge case coverage

3. **Migration Strategy with Rollback Validation**
   - **Action**: Develop automated migration logic with comprehensive rollback testing and validation procedures
   - **Details**: Create backup mechanisms, version detection, rollback capabilities, and migration validation following component-based design principles
   - **Validation**: Test migration scenarios including rollback procedures using AAA pattern with various configuration states

### Technical Specifications
- **Required Tools**: pytest, jsonschema, PyYAML, Home Assistant config validation utilities, coverage.py
- **Key Configurations**: Single `config.yaml` at addon root with validated schema, deprecated config files gracefully handled
- **Integration Points**: Home Assistant addon config validation, MQTT discovery configuration, AI provider settings
- **Component Contracts**: ConfigLoader interface, SchemaValidator interface, MigrationManager interface with version compatibility
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for schema validation, integration tests for migration logic, component tests for config loading with AAA pattern

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: All configuration inputs validated against schema with sanitization for special characters and injection prevention
- **API Security**: Secure handling of API keys and sensitive configuration data with encryption at rest
- **Data Protection**: User configuration data encrypted and stored securely with access controls
- **HA Security Compliance**: [HA Security Documentation - Configuration](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/security/#configuration-security)

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **TDD Cycle**: Write configuration validation tests first using AAA pattern, implement schema validation to pass tests, refactor for clarity and performance
- **AAA Pattern Examples**:
  ```python
  def test_schema_validation_with_invalid_ai_provider():
      # Arrange
      invalid_config = {"ai_provider": "invalid_provider", "temperature": 0.7}
      validator = ConfigSchemaValidator()
      
      # Act
      result = validator.validate(invalid_config)
      
      # Assert
      assert not result.is_valid
      assert "ai_provider" in result.errors
      assert "invalid_provider" in result.errors["ai_provider"]
  
  def test_input_sanitization_prevents_injection():
      # Arrange
      malicious_input = {"name": "<script>alert('xss')</script>", "path": "../../../etc/passwd"}
      sanitizer = ConfigInputSanitizer()
      
      # Act
      sanitized = sanitizer.sanitize(malicious_input)
      
      # Assert
      assert "<script>" not in sanitized["name"]
      assert "../" not in sanitized["path"]
      assert sanitized["name"] == "alert('xss')"
  ```
- **Component Strategy**: Design configuration module for easy testing, future extensibility, and clear interface contracts

### Technical Guidelines
- **Time Estimate**: 40-50 hours including comprehensive testing, validation, and documentation
- **Dependencies**: Completion of Phase 0 pre-implementation audit with documented baseline metrics
- **HA Standards**: [HA Addon Configuration Schema](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/configuration/#configuration-schema) compliance required

### MCP Server Usage Requirements
- **Mandatory MCP Servers**: 
  - **WebFetch**: Research current HA addon configuration standards from developers.home-assistant.io
  - **GitHub MCP**: **CRITICAL** - Version control for configuration changes and rollback capability
- **Optional MCP Servers**:
  - **zen**: Collaborate with Gemini for complex schema design decisions and validation strategy
  - **Task**: Search for existing configuration patterns and validation approaches across the project
- **Research Requirements**: Use WebFetch to validate against latest HA addon config documentation before implementation
- **Analysis Requirements**: Apply Context7 sequential thinking for configuration migration strategy analysis
- **Version Control Requirements**: Create feature branch `phase-1a-config-consolidation`, commit after each milestone
- **Monitoring Integration**: Use GitHub MCP to track configuration change progress and validation status

### Home Assistant Compliance Notes
- **Critical Compliance Issues**: 
  - Configuration schema must include required `name`, `version`, `slug` fields
  - All configuration options must have proper `type` and `description` fields
  - Default values required for optional configuration parameters
- **Specific Documentation**: 
  - [Configuration Schema Requirements](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/configuration/#configuration-schema)
  - [Addon Manifest Validation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/configuration/#add-on-configuration)
- **Validation Requirements**: Run `ha addons validate` command to verify schema compliance

### Rollback and Recovery Procedures
- **Pre-Phase Checkpoint**: Use GitHub MCP to create branch `phase-1a-config-consolidation` and commit current state
- **Incremental Commits**: Commit after each configuration file analysis, schema design milestone, and migration step
- **Rollback Triggers**: Configuration validation failures (>5% error rate), user configuration corruption, migration errors affecting >10% of configs
- **Recovery Strategy**: Use GitHub MCP to revert to last stable commit, restore backup configurations from automated backups, restart consolidation from validated checkpoint

### Collaborative Review and Validation Process
- **Implementation Validation**: Complete configuration consolidation, schema validation, and migration logic with all tests passing
- **Self-Assessment**: Verify all seven checklist items met with documented evidence and performance metrics
- **Gemini Review Request**: Use zen MCP to request comprehensive Gemini review of:
  - Configuration schema design and validation logic effectiveness
  - Migration strategy safety, completeness, and edge case handling
  - Test coverage adequacy and AAA pattern implementation quality
  - Home Assistant configuration compliance and certification readiness
- **Collaborative Analysis**: Work with Gemini to identify:
  - Schema design improvements and validation gaps with specific recommendations
  - Migration edge cases and safety enhancements not previously considered
  - Test coverage gaps and additional validation scenarios
  - Configuration optimization opportunities for performance and usability

  - Enhance schema validation and error handling based on expert feedback
  - Add missing migration scenarios and safety checks identified in review
  - Expand test coverage for edge cases discovered through collaboration
  - Optimize configuration structure and defaults for better user experience
- **Re-Review Cycle**: Have Gemini review changes until consensus achieved on:
  - Schema robustness and validation completeness meeting production standards
  - Migration safety and reliability with comprehensive error handling
  - Test coverage adequacy and quality exceeding industry standards
  - Overall configuration architecture excellence and maintainability
- **Final Consensus**: Both parties agree configuration consolidation is production-ready and meets all quality standards

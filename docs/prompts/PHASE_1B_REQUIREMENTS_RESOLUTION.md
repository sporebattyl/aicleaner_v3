# Phase 1B: Requirements Dependency Resolution

## 1. Context & Objective
- **Primary Goal**: Resolve conflicts between root and addon requirements.txt files, eliminate version inconsistencies, and establish a clean dependency management strategy
- **Phase Context**: Following configuration consolidation (Phase 1A), this phase ensures reliable package management and resolves the blocking dependency conflicts identified in the audit
- **Success Impact**: Enables stable addon builds, eliminates installation conflicts, and provides foundation for reliable AI model integration in Phase 2

## 2. Implementation Requirements

### Core Tasks
1. **Dependency Conflict Analysis and Resolution**
   - **Action**: Perform comprehensive analysis of dependency conflicts between root and addon requirements files using automated tools
   - **Details**: Use TDD approach to create dependency validation tests, identify version conflicts, and implement resolution strategy with clear separation of concerns
   - **Validation**: Write tests that verify dependency compatibility and catch future conflicts automatically

2. **Requirements Architecture Redesign**
   - **Action**: Design clean requirements architecture with development, production, and optional dependency categories
   - **Details**: Create modular requirements structure following component-based design with base requirements, AI provider requirements, and development requirements
   - **Validation**: Implement comprehensive installation tests across different environments using AAA test pattern

3. **Dependency Security and Optimization**
   - **Action**: Audit all dependencies for security vulnerabilities and optimize for minimal installation footprint
   - **Details**: Implement automated security scanning, version pinning strategy, and requirement optimization while maintaining functionality
   - **Validation**: Create security tests and performance benchmarks for dependency installation and runtime impact

### Technical Specifications
- **Required Tools**: pip-tools, safety, pipdeptree, pytest, Docker for environment testing
- **Key Configurations**: Single authoritative requirements.txt, development requirements separate, clear dependency pinning strategy
- **Integration Points**: Docker build process, Home Assistant addon installation, CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for dependency validation, integration tests for installation processes, security tests for vulnerability detection

## 3. Quality Assurance

### Success Criteria (TDD-Based)
- [ ] Zero dependency conflicts between root and addon requirements with automated validation
- [ ] All security vulnerabilities resolved with ongoing monitoring tests
- [ ] Installation size optimized with performance benchmarks confirming improvement
- [ ] Build reliability improved to 100% success rate across environments
- [ ] Development environment setup streamlined with automated testing

### Component Design Validation
- [ ] Dependency management component has single responsibility for package coordination
- [ ] Clear interface between dependency management and addon functionality
- [ ] Loose coupling achieved - dependency changes isolated from core functionality
- [ ] High cohesion within dependency management and security scanning modules

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Breaking existing installations - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing across multiple environments with rollback procedures
- **Medium Risk**: Performance regression from dependency changes - Mitigation: Benchmark testing and performance monitoring

## 4. Deliverables

### Primary Outputs
- **Code**: Clean requirements architecture with automated validation and security scanning
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test suite for dependency management, installation, and security following AAA pattern
- **Documentation**: Dependency management guide and security update procedures

### Review Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage for dependency management components
- **Code Review**: Requirements architecture review, security scanning validation, optimization assessment
- **Integration Testing**: Full installation testing across development, staging, and production environments

## 5. Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **TDD Cycle**: Write dependency validation tests first, implement resolution to pass tests, refactor for maintainability
- **AAA Pattern**: Structure tests with clear environment setup (Arrange), dependency operations (Act), and validation (Assert) sections
- **Component Strategy**: Design dependency management for easy testing, monitoring, and future updates

### Technical Guidelines
- **Time Estimate**: 30-40 hours including comprehensive testing and validation
- **Dependencies**: Completion of Phase 1A configuration consolidation
- **HA Standards**: Follow Home Assistant addon dependency management best practices and security requirements

### MCP Server Usage Requirements
- **Mandatory MCP Servers**: 
  - **WebFetch**: Research latest Python packaging security guidelines and HA dependency standards
  - **WebSearch**: Find current security vulnerability databases and dependency analysis tools
  - **GitHub MCP**: **CRITICAL** - Version control for dependency changes and build validation
- **Optional MCP Servers**:
  - **zen**: Collaborate with Gemini for complex dependency conflict resolution strategies
  - **Task**: Search for dependency-related issues across the codebase
- **Research Requirements**: Use WebFetch to validate against current security best practices and HA requirements
- **Analysis Requirements**: Apply Context7 sequential thinking for dependency resolution strategy analysis
- **Version Control Requirements**: Create feature branch, commit after each requirements change, validate builds before merge

### Rollback and Recovery Procedures
- **Pre-Phase Checkpoint**: Use GitHub MCP to create branch `phase-1b-requirements-resolution` and backup current requirements files
- **Incremental Commits**: Commit after dependency analysis, each requirements file update, and security validation
- **Rollback Triggers**: Build failures, dependency conflicts, security vulnerabilities introduced, installation failures
- **Recovery Strategy**: Use GitHub MCP to revert requirements files to last working state, restore from backup, re-run dependency analysis

### Collaborative Review and Validation Process
- **Initial Implementation**: Complete dependency conflict resolution, requirements architecture redesign, and security optimization
- **Gemini Review Request**: Use zen MCP to request comprehensive review of dependency management strategy and security compliance
- **Iterative Refinement**: Collaborate with Gemini to optimize dependency resolution and enhance security measures
- **Final Consensus**: Achieve agreement that dependency management is robust, secure, and ready for production

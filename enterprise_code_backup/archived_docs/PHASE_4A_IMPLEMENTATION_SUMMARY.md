## Home Assistant Dashboard Integration

### Entity Cards
Users can now add AICleaner v3 entities to their Home Assistant dashboards:

```yaml
# Example dashboard card
type: entities
title: AICleaner v3
entities:
  - entity: sensor.aicleaner_v3_system_health
  - entity: sensor.aicleaner_v3_total_requests
  - entity: sensor.aicleaner_v3_active_providers
  - entity: switch.aicleaner_v3_system_enabled
  - entity: switch.aicleaner_v3_provider_openai_enabled
  - entity: switch.aicleaner_v3_provider_anthropic_enabled
```

### Automation Integration
AICleaner v3 entities can be used in Home Assistant automations:

```yaml
# Example automation
automation:
  - alias: "AICleaner Provider Control"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.aicleaner_v3_system_health
        to: "degraded"
    action:
      - service: aicleaner_v3.control_provider
        data:
          provider_id: "backup_provider"
          action: "enable"
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- **Service Authentication**: All service calls authenticated via HA security
- **WebSocket Security**: WebSocket connections use HA session management
- **Entity Access**: Entity access controlled by HA permissions

### Data Privacy
- **Local Processing**: All entity data processed locally within HA
- **Secure Communication**: WebSocket connections encrypted
- **Access Control**: Entity access limited to authorized users

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Event Processing
- **Event Filtering**: Only relevant events are processed and bridged
- **Batch Updates**: Multiple entity updates batched for efficiency
- **Connection Management**: WebSocket connections efficiently managed

### Resource Management
- **Memory Usage**: Event history limited to prevent memory growth
- **CPU Usage**: Lightweight event processing with minimal overhead
- **Network Usage**: Efficient WebSocket communication

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Phase 4B Additions
- **MQTT Integration**: Direct MQTT device discovery and control
- **Advanced Automation**: Complex automation rule engines
- **Voice Control**: Integration with HA voice assistants
- **Mobile App**: Enhanced mobile app integration

### Scalability Considerations

## ðŸŽ¯ **TOP PRIORITY ITEMS FOR GEMINI REVIEW**

### **PRIORITY 1 - VALIDATE CLAUDE'S CRITICAL FIXES**

#### **Task 1A: Validate Authentication Implementation**
**Files to Review:**
- `core/config.default.yaml` (added `api_key_enabled: false`)
- `core/service.py` (added `get_api_key_or_allow_local` dependency)

**Validation Needed:**
- Confirm authentication implementation is secure and production-ready
- Verify the local bypass logic is appropriate for hobbyist use
- Check that all sensitive endpoints are properly protected
- Validate error messages are clear and helpful

**Expected Outcome:** Confirm or improve the authentication system

#### **Task 1B: Validate HA Integration Auth Compatibility** 
**Files to Review:**
- `custom_components/aicleaner/api_client.py` (fixed headers: `Authorization: Bearer` â†’ `X-API-Key`)

**Validation Needed:**
- Confirm header fix resolves compatibility issue
- Verify all API calls use correct authentication
- Test error handling for authentication failures
- Ensure local bypass works correctly

**Expected Outcome:** Confirm 100% HA integration compatibility

#### **Task 1C: Validate Performance Fixes** 
**Files to Review:**
- `core/service.py` (async file I/O fixes lines 480-483, 507-509)
- `core/service.py` (provider switching persistence lines 697-743)
- `requirements-core.txt` (aiofiles dependency added)

**Validation Needed:**
- Confirm async file operations don't block event loop
- Verify provider switching persists changes and hot-reloads correctly
- Test that configuration updates work smoothly
- Validate aiofiles dependency is correctly added

**Expected Outcome:** Performance issues resolved, no event loop blocking

#### **Task 1D: Validate Enhanced Error Handling**
**Files to Review:**
- `custom_components/aicleaner/coordinator.py` (smart error categorization)
- `custom_components/aicleaner/sensor.py` (connection status sensor)

**Validation Needed:**
- Confirm error categorization works correctly
- Verify smart retry logic and cached data fallback
- Test connection status sensor displays useful information
- Validate reduced polling frequency for persistent errors

**Expected Outcome:** Robust error handling with user-visible status

---

### **PRIORITY 2 - VALIDATE DOCUMENTATION FIXES**

#### **Task 2A: Validate Authentication Documentation** âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Files Updated:**
- `README.md` - Added comprehensive security configuration section

**Implemented:**
- âœ… Clear setup instructions for enabling authentication
- âœ… Environment variable configuration guidance
- âœ… Example configurations for hobbyist and production use
- âœ… Security best practices with strong API key generation
- âœ… Upgrade guide for existing installations

**Expected Outcome:** âœ… Complete authentication documentation added

#### **Task 2B: Fix Service Startup Documentation**
**Files to Update:**
- `README.md` - Clarify where and how to run core service
- `INSTALL.md` - Add service management instructions

**Requirements:**
- Clear instructions on where to run `python3 -m core.service`
- How to verify the service is running
- Basic troubleshooting for service startup issues

**Expected Outcome:** Users can successfully start and verify core service

---

### **PRIORITY 3 - IMPLEMENT PERFORMANCE CRITICAL FIXES**

#### **Task 3A: Fix Async File I/O in Core Service**
**File to Fix:** `core/service.py:448-479`

**Problem:** 
```python
# Lines 448-479 use synchronous file operations that block the event loop
with open(user_config_file, 'w') as f:
    yaml.dump(current_user_config, f, default_flow_style=False, indent=2)
```

**Solution Required:**
- Replace synchronous file operations with async equivalents
- Use `aiofiles` or similar async file library
- Ensure error handling is maintained
- Test that config updates don't block other requests

**Expected Outcome:** Non-blocking configuration updates

#### **Task 3B: Fix Provider Switching Persistence**
**File to Fix:** `core/service.py:660-680`

**Problem:**
```python
# Provider switch doesn't persist or update the active service
# Changes aren't saved to configuration
# ai_service doesn't get updated with new provider
```

**Solution Required:**
- Update active provider in configuration file
- Trigger hot reload to apply provider change
- Update ai_service instance with new active provider
- Return meaningful success/failure responses

**Expected Outcome:** Provider switches persist and work correctly

---

### **PRIORITY 4 - IMPLEMENT SECURITY HARDENING**

#### **Task 4A: Add Secret Detection Validation**
**File to Enhance:** `core/config_loader.py`

**Enhancement Required:**
- Add validation to detect plaintext secrets in configuration
- Warn users when API keys are not using environment variables
- Prevent accidental exposure of secrets in logs
- Add security audit functionality

**Expected Outcome:** Prevents insecure configuration practices

#### **Task 4B: Enhance Error Handling**
**Files to Enhance:** `custom_components/aicleaner/api_client.py`, `coordinator.py`

**Enhancements Required:**
- Categorize errors by type (auth, timeout, service down, etc.)
- Implement smart retry logic for different error types  
- Add user-visible error notifications in HA UI
- Create connection status sensor

**Expected Outcome:** Better error handling and user experience

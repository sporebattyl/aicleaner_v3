DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION REQUEST - ACTUAL DIFFS NEEDED

Gemini, thank you for the thinking process summary. Now I need the actual implementation - the specific diffs for each of the 14 prompts.

Please provide the actual diff content for each phase, starting with the first 3 as examples:

=== PHASE_1B_CONFIGURATION_MIGRATION_ENHANCEMENT.diff ===

### Key Additions Required:

1. **User-Facing Error Reporting Strategy**
   - Error Classification: Configuration migration failures, version incompatibility errors, data corruption detection, backup restoration issues
   - Progressive Error Disclosure: Simple "Migration failed" message for users, detailed version compatibility info for troubleshooting, full error logs for developers
   - Recovery Guidance: Step-by-step rollback to previous configuration, manual migration instructions, automated recovery options
   - Error Prevention: Pre-migration validation checks, compatibility testing, backup verification before migration

2. **Structured Logging Strategy**
   - Log Levels: DEBUG (migration step details), INFO (migration progress milestones), WARN (compatibility warnings), ERROR (migration failures), CRITICAL (data corruption risks)
   - Log Format Standards: JSON logs with migration_id, source_version, target_version, step_progress, timestamp, error_context
   - Contextual Information: Configuration file paths, migration duration, data size metrics, rollback checkpoint data
   - Integration Requirements: Home Assistant migration log aggregation, automated migration reporting, progress tracking

3. **Enhanced Security Considerations**
   - Continuous Security: Configuration data exposure during migration, temporary file security, backup encryption
   - Secure Coding Practices: Encrypted backup storage, secure file permissions during migration, input validation for migration parameters
   - Dependency Vulnerability Scans: Migration utility security scanning, backup tool vulnerability assessment

4. **Success Metrics & Performance Baselines**
   - KPIs: Migration completion rate (>95%), migration time (<30 seconds), rollback success rate (100%), data integrity validation (100%)
   - Performance Baselines: Memory usage during migration (<50MB), disk space requirements (<100MB temporary), concurrent migration handling
   - Benchmarking Strategy: Before/after migration performance comparison, automated migration testing, regression detection

5. **Developer Experience & Maintainability**
   - Code Readability: Migration step documentation, clear error messaging, intuitive rollback procedures
   - Testability: Migration simulation frameworks, rollback testing utilities, compatibility test suites
   - Configuration Simplicity: One-click migration process, automatic backup creation, user-friendly progress indicators
   - Extensibility: Pluggable migration handlers, version-specific migration modules, future-proof migration architecture

### Specific Implementation Notes:
Focus on automated configuration migration with comprehensive rollback capabilities. Ensure all legacy configurations are preserved and validated during migration process.

=== PHASE_1C_CONFIGURATION_TESTING_ENHANCEMENT.diff ===

[Continue with Phase 1C specific details...]

=== PHASE_2A_AI_MODEL_OPTIMIZATION_ENHANCEMENT.diff ===

[Continue with Phase 2A specific details...]

Please provide the complete detailed implementation for all 14 phases with specific, actionable content for each section.

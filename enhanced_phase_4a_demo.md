## Enhanced 6-Section Framework with HA-Specific Patterns

### 1. User-Facing Error Reporting Strategy
- **Error Classification**: HA Supervisor connection failures (API timeout with exponential backoff, authentication issues with token refresh, permission errors with clear resolution steps), HA service call errors (invalid service with suggestions, parameter validation with schema feedback, execution failures with retry logic), entity registration issues (duplicate entities with conflict resolution, invalid device class with compliance guidance, state update failures with rollback procedures), config flow errors (validation failures with field-specific feedback, migration issues with version compatibility checks, setup wizard problems with step-by-step recovery)
- **Progressive Error Disclosure**: Simple "Home Assistant connection issue - checking status" for end users with progress indicators, detailed HA integration status with specific service/entity information and health metrics for troubleshooting, comprehensive HA API logs with request/response details, correlation IDs, and timing analysis for developers
- **Recovery Guidance**: Automatic HA Supervisor reconnection with exponential backoff and user notification with progress indicators, step-by-step HA configuration validation with direct links to HA integration troubleshooting documentation and community resources, "Copy HA Integration Details" button for community support and issue reporting with sanitized logs
- **Error Prevention**: Proactive HA Supervisor health monitoring with early warning alerts and automated recovery, continuous HA service availability checking with predictive failure detection, automated HA entity state validation with consistency checks, pre-configuration validation for HA compatibility with version matrix checking

### 2. Structured Logging Strategy with HA Integration
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG (HA API request/response details with timing, entity state change tracking with diffs, service call parameter logging with sanitization), INFO (HA Supervisor connection status with health metrics, entity registration events with success/failure tracking, config flow progress with step completion rates), WARN (HA version compatibility warnings with migration suggestions, service deprecation notices with alternatives, entity unavailability with recovery procedures), ERROR (HA API failures with retry logic, entity registration failures with rollback procedures, service call errors with fallback mechanisms), CRITICAL (HA Supervisor connection lost with emergency procedures, complete integration failure with disaster recovery, security violations with incident response)
- **Log Format Standards**: Structured JSON logs with ha_integration_id (unique identifier propagated across all HA-related operations), supervisor_api_version with compatibility matrix, entity_id with device context, service_name with call parameters, device_id with registration status, ha_core_version with feature compatibility, integration_status with health indicators, api_response_time_ms with performance trending, error_context with detailed HA-specific failure information and recovery suggestions
- **Contextual Information**: Home Assistant core version and integration compatibility matrix, HA Supervisor API endpoints and response times with trending analysis, entity registry status and device information with health indicators, HA service registry and automation integration status with dependency tracking, HA configuration validation results with compliance scoring
- **Integration Requirements**: Home Assistant Supervisor logging endpoint integration with structured log forwarding and filtering, HA addon log aggregation in Supervisor dashboard with custom views, configurable HA integration log levels with runtime adjustment, automated HA integration reporting with trend analysis, integration with HA system health for addon status monitoring and alerting

### 3. Enhanced Security Considerations with HA Compliance

- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Advanced automation and learning algorithms

## Tracking Status
- **Total Items**: 45 incomplete items across all phases
- **High Priority**: 2 items
- **Medium Priority**: 15 items  
- **Low Priority**: 28 items
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-17 (Phase 4A completion)

## Notes
- Items are tracked but not blocking current phase progression
- Priority levels may be adjusted based on user feedback and production needs
- Security-related items should be prioritized for production deployment
- Performance-related items should be addressed during Phase 5A optimization

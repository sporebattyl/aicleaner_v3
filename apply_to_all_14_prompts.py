SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT REQUEST - ALL 14 REMAINING PROMPTS

Gemini, I need you to apply our validated 100/100 pattern from Phase 1A to all remaining 14 prompts systematically. 

CONTEXT:
- We achieved 100/100 readiness on Phase 1A through collaborative refinement
- Master template is now proven at `MASTER_TEMPLATE_100.md`
- Need to enhance all remaining prompts to same standard

REMAINING 14 PROMPTS TO ENHANCE:
Phase 1B: Configuration Migration & Validation
Phase 1C: Configuration Testing & Quality Assurance
Phase 2A: AI Model Provider Optimization
Phase 2B: Response Quality Enhancement
Phase 2C: AI Performance Monitoring
Phase 3A: Device Detection Enhancement
Phase 3B: Zone Configuration Optimization
Phase 3C: Security Audit & Hardening
Phase 4A: Home Assistant Integration Improvement
Phase 4B: MQTT Discovery Enhancement
Phase 4C: User Interface Improvements
Phase 5A: Performance Optimization
Phase 5B: Resource Management
Phase 5C: Production Deployment

ENHANCEMENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Apply the exact pattern that achieved 100/100 in Phase 1A
2. Include all critical sections: User-Facing Error Reporting, Structured Logging
3. Maintain TDD/AAA/Component-based design principles
4. Include MCP server usage requirements
5. Add HA compliance validation
6. Include rollback and recovery procedures

REQUESTED OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please provide a comprehensive diff that shows exactly what sections to add to each of the 14 prompts. Structure it as:

```diff
=== PHASE_1B_ENHANCEMENT.diff ===
--- Phase 1B: Configuration Migration & Validation (Current)
+++ Phase 1B: Configuration Migration & Validation (100/100)
@@ -XX,X +XX,XX @@
[specific additions for Phase 1B]

=== PHASE_1C_ENHANCEMENT.diff ===
--- Phase 1C: Configuration Testing & Quality Assurance (Current)  
+++ Phase 1C: Configuration Testing & Quality Assurance (100/100)
@@ -XX,X +XX,XX @@
[specific additions for Phase 1C]

[Continue for all 14 phases...]
```

COLLABORATION AGREEMENT:
- You create the systematic enhancement diff
- I'll review your diff and either agree or collaborate until consensus
- Once we agree, I'll apply the enhancements to achieve 100/100 across all prompts

Are you ready to create this comprehensive 14-prompt enhancement diff?

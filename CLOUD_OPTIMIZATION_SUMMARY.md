        capability_score = calculate_capability_match(provider, context)
        cost_score = calculate_cost_efficiency(provider, context)  
        performance_score = calculate_performance_history(provider, context)
        
        total_score = (
            capability_score * weights.capability_match +
            cost_score * weights.cost_efficiency + 
            performance_score * weights.performance_score
        )
```

    #         response_time > threshold, budget_exceeded, privacy_requirements
    
async def get_failover_targets(failed_provider, all_configs, content_analysis) -> List[FailoverTarget]:
    # Returns ordered list based on strategy: tier_based, capability_preserving, 
    #         cost_aware, performance_optimized, privacy_preserving
```

**Key Features:**
- 5 failover strategies
- Predictive failover based on performance trends
- Multi-tier routing with capability preservation
- Cloud→local failover with privacy compliance

### 6. **Performance Monitoring System** (`performance_monitor.py`)
```python
# Real-time performance analytics
class EnhancedPerformanceMonitor:
    metrics = [RESPONSE_TIME, COST, SUCCESS_RATE, QUALITY_SCORE, THROUGHPUT, CACHE_HIT_RATE]
    alerts = [INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL]
    
    def record_request_completion(provider, request, response, content_analysis):
        # Updates: performance_metrics, cost_tracking, real-time stats
        # Triggers: threshold alerts, budget warnings
```

**Key Features:**
- 6 metric types with configurable thresholds
- Cost tracking with budget alerts
- Optimization recommendations

### 7. **Optimized AI Provider Manager** (`optimized_ai_provider_manager.py`)
```python
# Main orchestration layer
async def process_request(request: AIRequest) -> AIResponse:
    # 1. Content Analysis
    content_analysis = await self.content_analyzer.analyze_content(request)
    
    # 2. Cache Check
    cached_response = await self.smart_cache.get(request, content_analysis)
    if cached_response: return cached_response
    
    # 3. Provider Selection  
    provider = await self.provider_selector.select_provider(...)

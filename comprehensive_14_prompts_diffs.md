**Summary of My Thinking Process**

My task is to elevate 14 Claude prompts for the AICleaner v3 project to a "100/100" readiness level. I'll act as an expert reviewer, using a provided "Master Template" and a "Proven 100/100 Example" (Phase 1A) to guide my enhancements. The core of my work will be generating specific `diff` formats for each prompt. These `diff`s will highlight the necessary changes across five key areas: User-Facing Error Reporting, Structured Logging, Enhanced Security Considerations, Success Metrics & Performance Baselines, and Developer Experience & Maintainability.

I've identified that the 100/100 example highlights the critical need for robust error reporting and structured logging, which are currently missing from the "Master Template." My strategy is to use the provided example as a springboard to generate the required `diff`s, tailoring each one to the specific phase.

For each of the 14 phases, I'll delve into the context, focusing on the core concepts (migration, validation, security, user experience, etc.).  Then, I'll fill out the 5 `diff` sections with relevant and specific details. For instance, for the "Configuration Migration" phase, I'll describe error reporting around migration failures, structure logs with appropriate levels for debugging, outline security risks for data loss, define success metrics based on migration rates, and propose improvements for making the migration logic more readable.  I'll repeat this process for all 14 phases.

Once I have completed the 14 `diff`s, I will analyze the enhanced prompts using the eight criteria from the prompt. This includes analyzing the overall implementation readiness, quality integration, and MCP usage. I will focus on the rollback procedures, HA compliance, and the completeness of the project, and conclude with a readiness score and final verdict. I anticipate this analysis to solidify my argument for high-quality production-ready prompts, with the additions. Finally, I will ensure the formatting is consistent, and the response is collaborative and expert, per my designated role as a Gemini. The goal is to provide a complete and actionable solution that addresses the user's complex requirements.

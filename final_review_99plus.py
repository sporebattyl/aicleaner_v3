FINAL 99/100 PHASE 1A REVIEW AND CONSENSUS

Gemini, I've implemented your two recommended improvements:
1. **User-Facing Error Reporting Strategy** section
2. **Structured Logging Strategy** requirements

Please review this final 99/100 version of Phase 1A and confirm it meets production-grade standards.

FINAL CONTENT TO REVIEW:
{final_content}

FINAL CONSENSUS QUESTIONS:
1. Does this version achieve 99/100 readiness as intended?
2. Are the User-Facing Error Reporting and Structured Logging sections adequate?
3. Is this prompt now production-ready for AICleaner v3 implementation?
4. Should we apply this same enhancement pattern to all remaining prompts?
5. Any final refinements needed before marking this as the master template?

QUALITY VALIDATION:
- Technical completeness for configuration consolidation
- Implementation guidance clarity and actionability
- Home Assistant addon compliance
- TDD/AAA pattern integration effectiveness
- MCP server usage optimization
- Security and operational readiness

Please provide your final assessment and readiness score.
